    <h4>Here is what you need for those creamy pancakes</h4>
        <p>You probably already have everything required to make this top-rated buttermilk pancake recipe.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's what you'll need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt — the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk:</strong> Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
            <li><strong> Milk:</strong> Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist</li>
        </ul> 
    
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>

    <h4>How to make those babies</h4>
        <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what to expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
       
    <h4>Step-by-step directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
